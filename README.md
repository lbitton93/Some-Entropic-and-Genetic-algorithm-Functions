# Some Entropic and Genetic Algorithm Functions

Here are some functions that I developed whilst I was at university.

## Getting Started

I can't quite recall the specifics as I haven't used Matlab in a year, but there is an option to browse and add a new Path to your
environment, it's fairly intuitive.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB

## Contributing

If you guys want to test and branch that would be great as it's fairly useless to me without access to MATLAB.
