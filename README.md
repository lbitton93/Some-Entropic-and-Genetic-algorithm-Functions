# Some Entropic and Genetic Algorithm Functions

Here are some functions that I developed whilst I was at university. I'm working on de-cluttering as there are several functions that ended up being a dead end.

## Getting Started

I can't quite recall the specifics as I haven't used Matlab in a year, but there is an option to browse and add a new Path to your
environment, it's fairly intuitive.

## Prerequisites

MATLAB

## Mathsy details

Here I will explain some of the commonplace function argument matrices and their representation:

datavectors: A 3D matrix
- This is a one hot encoded structure, where the i dimension represents the particular instance in the dataset
  the j dimension represents the particular variable / node $v$ in the graph and consequently position in the adjacency 
  matrix. The k dimension is a one-hot encoding of the state that $v$ occupies at it's given M(i,j).
  
## Contributing

If you guys want to test and branch that would be great as it's fairly useless to me without access to MATLAB.
